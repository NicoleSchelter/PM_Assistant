# Risk Management Plan
## E-Commerce Platform Modernization Project

### Risk Management Overview
This document outlines the approach for identifying, analyzing, and managing risks throughout the E-Commerce Platform Modernization project. The risk management process will be integrated into all project phases and regularly reviewed.

### Risk Management Process
1. **Risk Identification**: Continuous process throughout project lifecycle
2. **Risk Analysis**: Qualitative and quantitative assessment of identified risks
3. **Risk Response Planning**: Develop strategies to address high-priority risks
4. **Risk Monitoring**: Track identified risks and identify new risks
5. **Risk Communication**: Regular reporting to stakeholders

### Risk Categories
- **Technical Risks**: Technology, architecture, and integration challenges
- **Resource Risks**: Availability and capability of team members
- **Schedule Risks**: Timeline and dependency-related risks
- **Budget Risks**: Cost overruns and financial constraints
- **External Risks**: Vendor, regulatory, and market-related risks
- **Organizational Risks**: Change management and stakeholder alignment
