# Scheduling

## Overview

Project scheduling is the process of creating a detailed timeline that outlines when project activities will be performed, their duration, dependencies, and resource requirements. It involves breaking down project work into manageable activities, estimating durations, identifying dependencies, and creating a realistic timeline that supports project objectives. Effective scheduling provides a roadmap for project execution and serves as a baseline for monitoring and controlling project progress.

## Key Concepts

- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) development for comprehensive activity identification
- Activity sequencing using precedence diagramming method (PDM)
- Duration estimation using expert judgment, analogous estimating, and parametric estimating
- Critical Path Method (CPM) for identifying the longest sequence of dependent activities
- Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) for resource-constrained scheduling
- Schedule compression techniques including fast-tracking and crashing
- Resource leveling and smoothing for optimal resource utilization
- Schedule baseline establishment and change control processes

## Best Practices

- Develop a comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure before creating the schedule
- Involve team members and subject matter experts in duration estimation
- Identify all logical dependencies between activities accurately
- Use multiple estimation techniques to improve accuracy
- Build in appropriate buffers and contingency time
- Consider resource availability and constraints in schedule development
- Establish a realistic project baseline and manage changes formally
- Use scheduling software tools effectively while understanding their limitations
- Regularly update the schedule based on actual progress and changes
- Communicate schedule information clearly to all stakeholders

## Common Pitfalls

- Creating overly optimistic duration estimates without considering risks
- Failing to identify all dependencies between activities
- Not considering resource constraints and availability in schedule development
- Creating schedules that are too detailed for the project phase
- Ignoring the impact of external dependencies and constraints
- Not building in adequate buffer time for uncertainties
- Failing to update the schedule regularly based on actual progress
- Using scheduling tools without understanding the underlying logic
- Not involving team members in schedule development and validation
- Creating unrealistic schedules to meet arbitrary deadlines

## Tools and Techniques
