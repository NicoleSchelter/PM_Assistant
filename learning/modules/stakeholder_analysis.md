# Stakeholder Analysis

## Overview

Stakeholder analysis is the systematic identification, assessment, and management of individuals, groups, or organizations that can affect or are affected by a project. It involves understanding stakeholder needs, expectations, influence levels, and potential impact on project success. Effective stakeholder analysis enables project managers to develop targeted engagement strategies, manage expectations, and build the support necessary for project success.

## Key Concepts

- Stakeholder identification using brainstorming, organizational charts, and expert judgment
- Power-interest grid analysis to categorize stakeholders by influence and interest levels
- Stakeholder mapping and relationship analysis
- Communication requirements assessment based on stakeholder needs
- Engagement strategy development tailored to different stakeholder groups
- Stakeholder register creation and maintenance
- Influence network analysis and coalition building
- Cultural and organizational context consideration in stakeholder management

## Best Practices

- Start stakeholder identification early and update regularly throughout the project
- Use multiple techniques to ensure comprehensive stakeholder identification
- Assess both internal and external stakeholders systematically
- Develop tailored communication and engagement strategies for different stakeholder groups
- Regularly monitor stakeholder attitudes and adjust strategies accordingly
- Build positive relationships proactively rather than reactively
- Document stakeholder information in a centralized register
- Consider cultural differences and organizational dynamics in engagement approaches
- Involve key stakeholders in project planning and decision-making processes
- Establish clear escalation paths for stakeholder issues

- Focusing only on obvious stakeholders while missing hidden influencers
